# Travel Agency Website: Talokan

## Purpose: 
Helps to provide travel booking towards countries with beaches. This is what the agency is focused on. The agency focuses on honeymoon trips for couples who just want to experience the beautiful countries with their partners and not focus on the logistics of the trip. The website will provide information on travel destinations, travel packages, our services and different travel tips.

## Motivation:
As Lewis Carroll said:

> Actually, the best gift you could have 
> given her was a lifetime of adventures.

If i were to want to go overseas with my girlfriend to a beautiful destination. I would not want to go through the hassle of planning the destination. I would prefer an agency do it for me so I can focus on planning the important things that we will be doing instead. As a result of that pain point, a service that can provide travel packages for the type of vacation that we want would be of great use. Lovers could give each other the adventure that they will have in their beautiful journey, allowing them to make beautiful memories that will stick with them throughout their relationship.
